# SOLID
# Single responsability
# Open/Closed
    # Classes should be open to extension but closed to modification : the extension of a property does not affect an other property
# Liskov property 
    # Sub classes should have at least parent classes property
# Interface segregation
# Dependency Inversion: high level classes should nor change beacause low level classses change
